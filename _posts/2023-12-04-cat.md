title: "3D Printing Robotic Cat"

The final project theme I chose for this semester's CS F453 3D Printing & Robotics class is to make a **robot cat**. The cat's basic body parts, such as legs and torso, are **3D printed from PLA material**. The joints used to connect the calf, thighs, thighs and calves are **S51 (SG90) servo motors**, which are also used to make the cat perform various movements. The entire circuit is connected and controlled using **Funduino Uno (similar to Arduino Uno)**. The activity range of the servo motor arm is compiled in advance in Funduino Uno, and an **IR remote controller** is used to control the action combination.

The motivation for this project... is that I never had the chance to own a cat, so now I'm going crazy XD

## Source of Inspiration

My inspiration came from Nybble, a STEM teaching robot cat currently on the market. It is controlled by 11 servo motors, implementing 11 dimensions of freedom (DOF). My project only used Nybble's appearance design without exploring any of its code, because it sells for more than 250 dollars, which is quite expensive for me!
