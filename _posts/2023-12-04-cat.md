title: "3D Printing Robotic Cat"

The final project theme I chose for this semester's CS F453 3D Printing & Robotics class is to make a **robot cat**. The cat's basic body parts, such as legs and torso, are **3D printed from PLA material**. The joints used to connect the body, thighs, and calves are **S51 (SG90) servo motors**, which are also used to make the cat perform various movements. The entire circuit is connected and controlled using **Funduino Uno (similar to Arduino Uno)**. The activity range of the servo motor arm is compiled in advance in Funduino Uno, and an **IR remote controller** is used to control the action combination.

The motivation for this project... is that I never had the chance to own a cat, so now I'm going crazy XD

## Source of Inspiration

My inspiration came from Nybble, a STEM teaching robot cat currently on the market. It is controlled by 11 servo motors, implementing 11 dimensions of freedom (DOF). My project only used Nybble's appearance design without exploring any of its code, because it sells for more than 250 dollars, which is quite expensive for me!

## CAD Design

The cat's body frame was printed in one piece, and the space in the belly was reserved for Funduino Uno, breadboard, and circuit connections.

The printed cat body was like this, not very perfect, and some supporting materials in the belly part were pretty hard to remove.

The thigh left a space that matches the size of the S51 servo motor so that after printing, the servo motor can be embedded into this part to connect the calf.

The arm of the servo motor was fixed to the calf with strong glue. Super glue worked surprisingly well for this project and securely held the parts together.

## Funduino Connections

Originally, I wanted to use 10 S51 servo motors in my project: 2 for each leg, 1 for the tail, and 1 for the neck. However, considering the current and power withdrawal and I didn't have an available battery compartment with positive and negative wires (I only had a battery compartment with a barrel jack), I ended up connecting only four servo motors to the Funduino Uno and powered the entire circuit using a power bank (max USB output 5V/2.1A).
The board was chosen as Arduino Uno in the Arduino IDE because Funduino Uno is pretty much similar to Arduino Uno.
Six motors are used, four of them are connected in series to Funduino Uno; the two left motors were not used due to concern of power;
I used the IR remote controller and IR receiver 1838 to control the servos.

## What Worked & What Didn't Work

### Worked

- 3D printing was going well in general;
- All parts were delivered without damage (although I ordered SG90 and they shipped S51, these two types are basically the same);
- Servo motor connections were all good and moving together;
- IR remote control works well;
- Although a little bit struggling, the servo motors successfully support the heavy cat body frame;
- The assembly took some effort, but I was glad everything didn’t fall apart;
 - Some parts are reinforced using duct tape just in case the cat shakes wildly during movement;
 - The two back legs were directly glued to the body frame using a heated glue gun since they don’t need to move (for now).

### Didn't Work

At least 8 SG90 servo motors should be used according to the initial plan, while I finally went with 4:
Controlling 8 SG90 servo motors at the same time will withdraw larger currents. When the servo motor is subjected to a large gravity, its peak stall current can reach 750 mA. If there is insufficient additional power, such an operation will likely damage the circuit.
The SG90 servo motors seemed to be struggling to support the body frame:
The max torque of SG90 servo motor is 1.6 kg⋅cm (0.157 N⋅m), which should be strong enough; the S51 servo motor that I used had even more stall torque (at locked): 2.0±0.20kg·cm (4.8V ) 2.2±0.20kg·cm(6V), but the stall current (at locked) is higher too: 1300±40mA (4.8V ) 1600±50mA(6v). Using too many servo motors without an external power supply may damage the circuit.
The circuit board + Funduino Uno board might have added too much weight to the belly of the frame, making the servos struggle a little bit to raise the body (rise pose).
